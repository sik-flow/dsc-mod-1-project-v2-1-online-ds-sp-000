## Description

Microsoft is creating a new movie studio and they need information on successful movies. 
For this project, the most common genres produced with the highest average rating, popularity, and profit would be considered the most successful genres.

2. Which genres have the highest average rating and average popularity, and what is their correlation with the top 3 movie genres produced?
3. Which genres have the highest average profits, and does production budget have an effect on the profit?
4. How are average rating, popularity, and the length of a movie linked to the profit of a movie?

## Conclusion
